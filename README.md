Project 2

Title: NBA Visualizations

Members: Kim Sommer, Howard Mayorga, Stephanie Rivas & Ian Castro 

Project Description and Outline: We decided to create interactive charts that will tell a story through data visualizations that will illustrate specific information regarding NBA, teams, players and stats.  The illustrations that we are going to create will be on a dashboard in which will include a  interactive drop down list for teams and the player stats on a specific panel that is going provide the total points scored by players and season.


Research Questions: 

Metrics: 
1. Our visualizations will include a Python Flask–powered API, HTML/CSS, JavaScript, and at least one database (SQL, MongoDB, SQLite, etc.). 
2. Your project should fall into one of the below four tracks: ○ A custom “creative” D3.js project (i.e., a nonstandard graph or chart) ○ A combination of web scraping and Leaflet or Plotly ○ A dashboard page with multiple charts that update from the same data ○ A “thick” server that performs multiple manipulations on data in a database prior to visualization (must be approved) 
3. Our project will include at least one JS library that we did not cover. 
4. It must be powered by a data set with at least 100 records. 
5. The project must include some level of user-driven interaction (e.g., menus, dropdowns, textboxes). 
6. The final visualization should ideally include at least three views.

Rough Breakdown of Tasks:
Decompose the problem.
Examine and learn about each API & write request loops to pull appropriate data from each API.
Run loops & Put data into DataFrame.
Clean and merge  data.
Visualize and Analyze Data.
Make Observations regarding the tendencies we see.
Create Presentation and Summary Documents and make the Project accessible.
